Scraping all rugs from https://www.therugshopuk.co.uk/rugs-by-type/rugs.html with scrapy.

While going through some rugs online, I suddenly landed on a website that has these cheap and beautiful rugs.
The design on the rugs were so unique.

So I decided to scrap these rug data. The rugs on this websites are close to 6000+.
SO to begiin with these project,

I inspected the website, after that I located the data that I needed ( The rug name, the price, the rug image e.t.c..)
I then locate the pagination link (the next button),
I decided to code my spider in Jupyter then, I had to run it without saving the output
When I am sure that my spider is working then, I added the one line code to save the output as csv file.
